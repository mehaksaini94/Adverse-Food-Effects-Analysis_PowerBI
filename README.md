# Adverse Food Effects Analysis using PowerBI


## Overview

This project analyzes the adverse effects associated with various food items using the FDA's CAERS (Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Adverse Event Reporting System) dataset in Power BI. The goal is to identify trends, correlations, and insights that can help in understanding and potentially mitigating these adverse effects.

## Project Objective

- **Analyze** data related to adverse food effects.
- **Visualize** trends and patterns in food-related adverse reactions.
- **Identify** correlations and key insights to inform decision-making and improve food safety.

## Data Sources

- **Type of Data** CSV
- **Dataset Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fda/adverse-food-events/data
- **About Dataset**: The FDA CAERS dataset is used, containing records of adverse events related to food products. 
- **Data Cleaning:** Power Query is used to clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency in data formats. DAX is employed for advanced calculations and data transformations necessary for the analysis.
  
## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboards:** Multiple dashboards showcasing various aspects of adverse food effects, including the frequency of specific reactions, affected demographics, and correlations between food types and adverse effects.
  
- **Filtering and Drill-Down:** Allows users to filter data by various criteria such as time period, demographic information, and specific food items, with the ability to drill down into more detailed views.

- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare the severity and frequency of adverse effects across different food categories.

## Insights and Findings

- **Trend Analysis:** Summarize key trends observed in the data, such as any seasonal patterns, the most common food items associated with adverse effects, or any other significant findings.
  
- **Correlation Analysis:** Discuss any correlations found between certain food items and specific adverse effects. Highlight any unexpected or particularly strong correlations.

- **Demographic Insights:** Provide insights into which demographics are most affected by adverse food effects and any patterns observed.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Data Preparation Tools:** If you used any tools for data preprocessing (e.g., Excel, Python), list them here.
  
## Installation and Usage

1. **Download the Project Files:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the Power BI File:** Launch the `Mehak_Saini_adverse_food_analysis_2.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
3. **Explore the Dashboards:** Use the interactive features in Power BI to explore the various dashboards and insights.

## Screenshots

_Include a few screenshots of your Power BI dashboards to give users a preview of what they can expect._

## Future Work

- **Data Expansion:** Consider expanding the dataset to include more recent data or additional sources to enhance the analysis.
- **Predictive Analysis:** Implement predictive models to forecast potential adverse effects based on food consumption trends.
- **Enhanced Interactivity:** Add more interactive elements to the dashboards, such as user input fields for custom queries.
